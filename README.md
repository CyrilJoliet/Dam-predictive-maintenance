# Master Thesis â€“ Predictive Maintenance of Dams

This repository contains the work conducted as part of my master's thesis at UCLouvain.
The research focuses on **anomaly detection in dam monitoring data** using the HST statistical model and multivariate analysis.

## ðŸ“– Project Overview
The goal of this thesis was to develop a method for early detection of anomalies in dam monitoring data, with a focus on:
- **Uplift pressure** in concrete foundations  
- **Internal erosion** in embankment dams  

The approach combines:
- **HST time-series modeling** to predict sensor measurements  
- **Multidimensional residual analysis** (Mahalanobis distance) to detect anomalies across multiple sensors

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
- `report/` â†’ Full thesis (PDF)  
- `scripts/` â†’ Analysis scripts and modeling steps  
- `figures/` â†’ Key plots and visualizations  

## ðŸš€ Main Results
- The method performs well on real monitoring data (foundations & embankments).  
- Simulated anomalies confirm the modelâ€™s ability to detect progressive failures.  
- Promising tool for **predictive maintenance** in dam safety.
